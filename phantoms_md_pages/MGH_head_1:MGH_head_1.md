### Phantom description

This phantom is based on a 1mm isotropic segmented head model which was
labeled as described in [Makris et
al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18985401).

The segmented head data was converted into a simplified surface model
with two compartments: Brain and other soft tissues. Bone and air (both
low epsilon, low conductivity) are printed together out of plastic
material with similar electrical properties.

### Special considerations

The sealing flange uses an o-ring.
