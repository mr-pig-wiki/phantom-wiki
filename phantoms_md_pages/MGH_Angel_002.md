### Phantom description

This phantom is similar to the [MGH "Angel 001"
phantom](https://phantoms.martinos.org/MGH_Angel_001), except that the
parts have been modified so that the filling port of the brain
compartment extends outside the outer shell. This allows refilling the
brain compartment as needed. The outer ("muscle") volume is 1610 mL. The
brain volume is 1160 mL.

### Special considerations

Please refer to the [MGH "Angel 001"
phantom](https://phantoms.martinos.org/MGH_Angel_001) for construction
instructions.

Although the brain filling port extends outside, this will allow you
re-filling the phantom only if the agar gel inside the brain compartment
is liquid enough. To achieve this, you should prepare the agar gel using
at most 1% agar in weight.

It is helpful to be able to re-fill the phantoms as needed. Although the
parts are waterproof and the phantom do not leak, there is a small
amount of evaporation that cannot be avoided and lead to a progressive
drying of the gel. This effect is more pronounced at the periphery of
the brain compartment and therefore could manifest itself by a change of
intensity in this region (similar to a "grey matter ribbon"). Also,
small cavities may appear 6-12 months after the initial filling.
