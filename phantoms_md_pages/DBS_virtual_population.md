### Models description

The models were created by combining head and neck CT examinations of
DBS patients into a "virtual CT" volume covering the entire implant
length. This allowed us to build model of the DBS implant covering the
entire length of the lead, extension cables and implantable pulse
generator (IPG). The body was discretized into bone, air and soft tissue
classes. The DBS implant models contain a insulating sheath, straight
internal conductors, electrodes and 2000 Ohm impedance connections to
the IPG. See the reference above for more details.
